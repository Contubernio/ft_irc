# **ft\_irc \- Internet Relay Chat Server**

## **📝 Description**

The goal of this project is to create an **IRC server** in **C++ 98**. It is a multi-user communication system where clients can connect, join channels, and exchange messages in real-time. The server handles multiple simultaneous connections using non-blocking I/O and the poll() mechanism to manage file descriptors efficiently, adhering to the **RFC 2812** standard.

Key features include:

* Full client authentication (PASS, NICK, USER).  
* Channel management (JOIN, PART, KICK, INVITE, TOPIC).  
* Private and group messaging (PRIVMSG, NOTICE).  
* Channel operator privileges and modes (i, t, k, o, l).  
* Support for standard IRC clients like **Irssi**.

## **🛠️ Instructions**

### **Compilation**

The project includes a Makefile with standard rules. To compile the server, run:

make

### **Execution**

Start the server by providing a port and a password:

./ircserv \<port\> \<password\>

### **Troubleshooting: Port Unblocking**

If the server closed unexpectedly and the port remains occupied ("Address already in use"):

\# Find the process ID (PID) using port 6667  
lsof \-i :6667

\# Kill the process (replace \<PID\> with the number from the command above)  
kill \-9 \<PID\>

### **Memory Leak Check (Valgrind)**

To ensure memory safety and undefined behavior tracking, run:

valgrind \--leak-check=full \--show-leak-kinds=all ./ircserv 6667 1234

*Note: Always close the server using Ctrl+C (SIGINT) to allow Valgrind to perform the final memory sweep correctly.*

## **👥 Multi-Client Testing**

### **1\. Automated Setup (Recommended)**

We provide a script to quickly stress-test the server with 6 different users joining the same channel:

cd extras
chmod \+x open\_clients.sh  
./open\_clients.sh

*Note: This script automates the PASS, NICK, USER, and JOIN \#42 sequence for each client.*

### **2\. Manual Connection (Netcat)**

If you prefer to connect manually using nc:

nc localhost 6667

**Required sequence after connecting:**

1. PASS \<password\>  
2. NICK \<nickname\>  
3. USER \<username\> 0 \* :\<realname\>

## **⌨️ Server Commands Reference**

| Command | Syntax | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **PASS** | PASS \<password\> | Authenticates the client with the server password. |
| **NICK** | NICK \<nickname\> | Sets your unique identifier on the server. |
| **USER** | USER \<user\> \<mode\> \* :\<real\> | Sets your username and real name. |
| **JOIN** | /JOIN \#\<channel\> \[key\] | Joins a channel (requires key if mode \+k is set). |
| **PRIVMSG** | /PRIVMSG \<target\> :\<text\> | Sends a private message to a user or a channel. |
| **NOTICE** | /NOTICE \<target\> :\<text\> | Similar to PRIVMSG, but no automatic replies are sent. |
| **PART** | /PART \#\<channel\> \[reason\] | Leaves the specified channel. |
| **KICK** | /KICK \#\<ch\> \<user\> \[reason\] | **(Ops only)** Forcibly removes a user from a channel. |
| **INVITE** | /INVITE \<user\> \#\<channel\> | Invites a user to an Invite-only channel (+i). |
| **TOPIC** | /TOPIC \#\<ch\> \[:new\_topic\] | Views or changes the channel's topic. |
| **QUIT** | /QUIT \[message\] | Disconnects and notifies all common channels. |
| **MODE** | /MODE \#\<ch\> \<modestring\> \[args\] | **(Ops only)** Manages channel/user permissions. |
| **BOT (Bonus)** | \!\<command\> | Interactive bot triggers (\!info, \!time, \!ping). |

### **🛠️ Detailed MODE Parameters (MODE \#channel)**

* \+i / \-i: **Invite-only** channel.  
* \+t / \-t: **Topic** restricted to operators.  
* \+k / \-k \<key\> | Sets or removes the channel **password**.  
* \+o / \-o \<user\> | Gives or takes **operator** status.  
* \+l / \-l \<limit\> | Sets or removes the maximum **user limit**.

## **🤖 Bonus Features**

### **Interactive Bot System**

Our server includes a dedicated Bot that responds to specific triggers via private message or channel:

* \!info: Displays information about the server version and authors.  
* \!time: Returns the current server time and date.  
* \!ping: The bot replies with "PONG\!" to check latency.

### **File Transfer (DCC)**

Our server supports **DCC (Direct Client-to-Client)** via Irssi:

* **Send:** /dcc send \<Receiver\_Nick\> /path/to/file.txt  
* **Receive:** /dcc get \<Sender\_Nick\>  
* **Status:** /dcc list

### **AI Usage Disclosure**

**Gemini 2.5 Flash** was used as a peer-collaborator for the following tasks:

* **Documentation & Formatting:** Structuring this README.md and translating technical requirements into English.  
* **Troubleshooting:** Explaining Irssi's behavior during the NICK command handshake and debugging port conflicts.  
* **Protocol Verification:** Validating IRC response codes and the logic for the MODE flag handling.
